# Global GDP Statistics Analysis

### A Data Analysis Project by **Darrius Allen**

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes **Global GDP data from the World Bank and United Nations (2025)** to identify patterns and insights in global economic performance.  
It demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow,  from data ingestion and cleaning to summary statistics and interpretation,  using Python, pandas, and matplotlib.

The notebook (`Global GDP Statistics.ipynb`) serves as part of my professional data portfolio, highlighting my ability to work with real-world data, clean and validate datasets, and communicate findings clearly for business and analytical audiences.

## Objectives

1. **Data Loading and Inspection**  
   - Import the Global GDP dataset using pandas.  
   - Explore the dataset structure, column names, and data types.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**  
   - Check for and remove duplicates.  
   - Identify and handle null or missing values.  
   - Ensure all numeric data (e.g., GDP per capita) are properly formatted for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Compute summary statistics such as mean, median, min, and max for GDP-related metrics.  
   - Examine GDP per capita distributions across regions and income groups.  
   - Identify trends and outliers in global economic data.

4. **Derived Metrics and Insights**  
   - Calculate the range of GDP per capita.  
   - Visualize GDP distributions and comparisons where applicable.  
   - Summarize economic disparities and patterns observed in the dataset.

## Results and Findings

After cleaning and analyzing the dataset, several insights were observed:

### Global GDP per Capita
The average GDP per capita across all countries was approximately **$16,000**, with the highest exceeding **$100,000** and the lowest below **$500**, indicating a wide disparity in global economic conditions.

### Top Economies
The top-performing economies included the **United States**, **China**, **Japan**, and **Germany**, which collectively accounted for a significant share of the worldâ€™s total GDP.

### Developing vs. Developed Regions
Developed nations showed GDP per capita values nearly **10 times higher** than developing regions, underscoring persistent income inequality.

### Data Range
The calculated range of GDP per capita demonstrated the vast economic spread,  a useful metric for comparative visualization and inequality assessment.
